1. State and discuss 5 Helpdesk Support Models

a. Single-Tier (One-Level) Support

This model has one unified team handling all issues, from basic password resets to complex technical problems. It is simple and cost-effective, but it can overwhelm staff and slow down response time since every request lands in the same bucket.

b. Multi-Tier Support (Tier 1, 2, 3)

Issues are escalated based on complexity.

Tier 1: Basic troubleshooting

Tier 2: More technical issues

Tier 3: Specialists or engineers
This model improves efficiency because each problem is handled by someone with the right skill level.


c. Follow-the-Sun Support

Support is delivered 24/7 by teams located in different time zones. When one region closes, another picks up. It is ideal for global organizations that need continuous service and minimal downtime.

d. Self-Service Support

Users diagnose and resolve common issues themselves using FAQs, knowledge bases, portals, and automated chatbots. This reduces the workload on human agents and increases efficiency for high-volume repetitive tasks.

e. Outsourced or Managed Service Desk

A company contracts external vendors to provide helpdesk services. It reduces cost and provides access to specialized teams, but it requires good vendor relationship management to maintain service quality.



2. Discuss 5 Best Practices of IT Helpdesk Operations

a. Clear Communication

Agents must communicate in simple, respectful, and organized language. Good communication reduces misunderstandings and improves user satisfaction.

b. Maintain a Knowledge Base

Documenting solutions, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides ensures quicker resolutions and consistency. It also empowers self-service.

c. Track and Prioritize Tickets

Using a ticketing system (e.g., Jira, Freshdesk, ServiceNow) helps categorize issues by urgency and impact. This ensures critical problems are handled first.

d. Regular Staff Training

Technology evolves quickly, so helpdesk staff must stay updated on new tools, threats, and processes. Skilled staff = faster resolutions.

e. Continuous Review and Feedback

Collecting user feedback, analyzing ticket metrics, and reviewing performance helps identify gaps and improve service delivery.



3. Analyse 5 Points to Consider When Rendering Helpdesk Services to a Client

a. Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

Before starting, understand the client’s expectations regarding response time, resolution time, and availability. This guides performance and avoids conflict.

b. Security and Data Privacy

You handle sensitive information, so ensure compliance with client security policies, access controls, and confidentiality requirements.

c. Understanding the Client’s Environment

Know the client’s systems, hardware, network setup, business processes, and common issues. The better you understand their environment, the faster you resolve issues.

d. Communication and Reporting

Clients value transparency. Decide how you’ll report incidents, progress updates, and performance metrics (daily, weekly, monthly).

e. Customer Experience and Professionalism

Beyond technical skill, you must be polite, patient, and empathetic. The client must feel supported, not judged.


4. Outline the Steps to Manage an Incident in Your Organisation

Step 1: Incident Logging

Record the issue in a ticketing system—include user details, description, time, and impact.

Step 2: Categorization and Prioritization

Classify the incident (e.g., software, hardware, network) and assign a priority level based on urgency and impact.

Step 3: Initial Diagnosis

Perform basic troubleshooting and gather more information from the user. Try quick fixes where possible.

Step 4: Escalation (If Needed)

If the issue is beyond your level, escalate it to higher-tier support or specialists while keeping the user updated.

Step 5: Investigation and Resolution

Work on the root cause, apply a solution, test it, and confirm with the user that the issue is resolved.

Step 6: Closure

Document the fix, update the ticket, and mark it as closed once the user is satisfied.

Step 7: Post-Incident Review

Analyze the incident—what caused it, how it was fixed, and how to prevent reoccurrence. This supports continuous improvement.
