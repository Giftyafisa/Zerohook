So my current location, I want you to look into the database and find me a Ghanaian user and edit her details to much that a sex service provder that mith be close to me and have it least some of the remendation filters ??

And and not the the algarithm is surposed to be in such a way that the system is to only my limited to providing feed by location filter but as so the rest of the filter they should work based on the all the users profile that are found in the site visitors or the one lking to find a siutable matches country and current location. Ask me more question to understand me better.


I understand! Let me clarify your requirements:

What I understand:
Test Data Request: You want me to find a Ghanaian user in the database and update their profile to look like a realistic sex service provider near Accra, so you can test the recommendation algorithm.

Algorithm Clarification: The recommendation algorithm should work in TWO scenarios:

For local users (like you in Accra): Show nearby providers first, then factor in quality, ratings, etc.
For visitors/searchers from other countries: Show profiles based on ALL criteria (not just location) - quality, ratings, success rate, activity, etc. - across the entire platform
My Questions:
For the test user: Should I create a completely new test provider profile, or should I find an existing user and convert them to a provider?

For the algorithm:

When a user from Nigeria visits, should they see:
Option A: Nigerian providers first, then other countries?
Option B: Best-rated providers globally, with location as just one factor?
User types: Are there two types of users?

Seekers/Clients: People looking for services (like you testing now)
Providers: Sex workers offering services
Should the "For You" feed:

Prioritize providers in the user's detected country?
Or show a mix of local + highly-rated international providers?

you got the above wrong.
I mean a user be it resgisted or unregister not local and visitor as you say bro.

For the test user: Should I create a completely new test provider profile, or should I find an existing user and convert them to a provider?  create 50 new ones and share them into the verious towns and cities in the Accra region.

For the algorithm:

When a user from Nigeria visits, should they see:
Option A: Nigerian providers first, then other countries? yes each country and it citizens feed first. but search of a speicific users profile  should not be bund by the location limite.

Option B: Best-rated providers globally, with location as just one factor? yes(but country specific based on the site users current country of origin)

User types: Are there two types of users?

Seekers/Clients: People looking for services (like you testing now) yes.
Providers: Sex workers offering services yes

But note that we may also have view/passerbys(visitors) who are not registed but are just check the platform out if they might find some interest to join it or not.

Should the "For You" feed:

Prioritize providers in the user's detected country? yes and current pin piont location to have sex provides around them.
Or show a mix of local + highly-rated international providers? location then starts degrading after most closerbys are not available. if you get what I mean. Just like how someone trying to order bolt or uber gets drivers or rides that are closest first before the rest that are not that closest follow.

And Note: If you take a look at our types of users that we admite to the system, you will notice we have the sex workers(sex providers) the 2 the ones in search of the sex service(client/costomers).

So note that the profilefeed/browser page is surposed to provide only the sex worker so do the differenciation well to avoid confusion.


Clear Understanding:
User Types:

Providers (Sex Workers): Listed on ProfileFeed for clients to browse
Clients (Seekers): Browse and search for providers
Visitors (Unregistered): Can browse but limited features
ProfileFeed Shows ONLY Providers - Never show clients/seekers in the feed

Algorithm Logic (Like Uber/Bolt):

Step 1: Show providers in user's CURRENT COUNTRY first
Step 2: Within country, prioritize by PROXIMITY (closest first like Uber)
Step 3: Apply quality factors (ratings, success rate, verification, activity)
Step 4: When nearby providers are exhausted, expand to further ones
Step 5: If searching specific profile, NO location limits
Test Data: Create 50 provider profiles spread across Accra region towns/cities

Let me:

First check the database and create the test providers
Then fix the algorithm to filter ONLY providers (accountType = 'provider')
Ensure country-first, then proximity-based ranking
